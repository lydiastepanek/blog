        <p>Do Americans actually care about security?</p><p>Unlike in Europe, where every single website asks for your permission to store cookies about you, websites in America seemingly don't ask for permission at all. Of course they store our credit card information, our addresses, our delivery preferences – how else would we be able to purchase a couch with one click? And do Americans like me necessarily care if our information is stored in a secure database? Not really – security has a high price, and, hey, it would make couch buying a lot harder.</p><p>At least it seemed to me that way for a long time.</p><p>Back in 2012, I graduated college and made an unconscious decision not to worry too much about my online footprint. Of course, there were some consequences: hackers stole my credit card information from Target <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-hackers-stole-millions-of-credit-card-records-from-target/">in 2013</a>, and they stole my social security number from my alma mater <a href="https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2018/08/02/a-decade-later-yale-discovers-major-data-breach/">in 2018</a>. In the grand scheme of things, these hacks didn’t affect me. In the first case, I simply got a new credit card, and in the second, I did what my grandma told me to do and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/14/your-money/credit-freeze-free.html">froze my credit report</a> at the major agencies. I’m no poorer or sadder because my data was breached online.</p><p>And when, in 2013, Edward Snowden revealed the extent to which Americans' online data (like, all internet communication) was being stored by our own government, I wasn’t scared about my internet behavior being illegally tracked by the NSA. <em>So what?</em> I thought to myself. If anything, I expected all my information to be shared everywhere, and I trusted that the NSA was using my data in ways that wouldn’t immediately harm me (and probably was deleting it pretty quickly once they realized how much time I spent shopping for a couch).</p><p>However, my concern about online security grew deeper in 2018 when I realized how freely companies share my data with other companies. Who can forget the Cambridge Analytica scandal, when Facebook gave the "This Is Your Digital Life" Facebook app access to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal">87 million</a> users' data – including access to those users’ News Feed, timeline, and personal messages – for YEARS. And this data wasn’t just being shared with that app; it was shared with ad partners like the Trump presidential campaign and the UK’s Vote Leave campaign. Regardless of your politics, the fact that political campaigns could read your <em>personal Facebook messages without your awareness</em> was probably a wake up call.</p><p>And it’s not just companies who share our data with other companies. As I’ve followed more cybersecurity litigation, I’ve realized that the U.S. government frequently asks Facebook for users’ data, and gets it. (See <a href="https://lydiaonsecurity.ghost.io/yes-the-government-can-ask-for-your-gmail-records/">my first blog post</a> for more info.) We no longer live in a world where you commit a crime and the FBI has to spend 15 months searching for evidence; now they can just send a search warrant to Facebook or Google to access your entire email history. Voila!</p><p>Clearly a complicated game is being played. But who are the players?</p><p>Well, first of all: us, the users of these websites.</p><p>Secondly, the platforms – Google, Apple, etc. – who host these websites and store our data. (And sell it to advertisers.)</p><p>Thirdly, the hackers who try to hack the companies on a seemingly hourly basis.</p><p>And fourthly, the government, who tries to punish the hackers, but in the process, reveals that the hackers are just like us in the first place, in that they too have all of their data easily accessible online.</p><p>It’s a fascinating and weird cycle that I’m only now waking up to – a whole new market has sprung up in the past 10 years, one that no one fully understands. So, in short, I started this blog to better understand the security game. How does this game work? What motivates companies to take data security more seriously? Is it that customers stop using a website when they find out that it secretly sells that information to third parties? Or is it that the government fines them after data breaches, and companies fear these fines? One thing is for sure – storing data securely is not an easy thing to do, and it’s only going to get harder.</p>
