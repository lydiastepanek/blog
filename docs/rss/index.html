They can enter my home, even, and search through my personal belongings. But up until recently, I didn&#x2019;t realize they could look through my Google search history. Call me naive, but logging onto a computer and visiting different pages of the internet felt sacred to me. And the amount of data I create is so vast I assumed it was untraceable. Really, who&#x2019;s going to record the 500 celebrity gossip pages I visit per day? (And which government agency actually cares enough to store that information?)</p><p>Silly me for thinking there were limits to the power of computing. I work for a database company; I should have known there are cheap-as-dirt data storage options out there. I guess it should not have been a surprise to me that tech companies store my search history indefinitely. (After all, I&#x2019;ve been getting ads for Christian Singles ever since that ONE date ten years ago.) And I guess it makes sense that the police can ask for that information if they have probable cause.</p><p>Case in point: I recently learned about the 2012 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_LinkedIn_hack">Linkedin hack</a>, in which Yevgeniy Nikulin, a Russian hacker, got remote access to a LinkedIn engineer&#x2019;s laptop and then broke into LinkedIn&#x2019;s database network and copied 6.5 million Linkedin users&#x2019; e-mail addresses, usernames, and password hashes. Nikulin was a smart hacker, and creative; he&apos;d gotten control of this engineer&apos;s work laptop <a href="https://darknetdiaries.com/transcript/86/">by uploading a malicious PHP file</a> to a website the engineer was hosting on his laptop. (He later reverse engineered the password hashes to subsequently impersonate a Dropbox engineer, then used that engineer&#x2019;s password to log into Dropbox&#x2019;s database and steal <a href="https://darknetdiaries.com/transcript/86/">20 million</a> Dropbox users&#x2019; passwords. Which just goes to show how valuable one LinkedIn password can be.) </p><p>The FBI took four years to investigate the hack and eventually charged Nikulin for identity theft and computer intrusion. Because Nikulin pled his innocence, the trial went to court, and became public. These public court documents reveal how much data got requested during that four year FBI investigation: the FBI had sent search warrants to Google, Vimeo, Automattic (the parent company of Wordpress), Microsoft, and many more companies. They traced the hack to the email address r00talka@gmail.com, then requested all of the Google search history and Gmail records associated with that email address, and they got them! The court documents even cite Nikulin&apos;s Google searches for a dentist in Moscow, which just proves how much information Google handed over.</p><p>That wasn&#x2019;t a one-off: in a later hack, the 2017 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack">WannaCry hack</a>, which shut down an estimated <a href="https://darknetdiaries.com/transcript/73/">230,000 computers worldwide</a>, the FBI found the hacker by requesting all Gmail records associated with various email addresses used in the attack. These emails were traced back to Gmail accounts owned by a North Korean man named Park Jin Hyok, and the FBI then used this information to indict him.</p><p>In some ways, I&#x2019;m OK with the government being able to retrieve information from Google in order to solve crimes. After all, I care about security, and you can&#x2019;t always have privacy if you want to protect people&#x2019;s security. I know what an FBI detective would tell me: that if an FBI agent unlawfully acquires information in a case, then a U.S. citizen can bring that FBI agent to court for unlawful collection of evidence. <em>Don&#x2019;t worry</em>, that FBI agent might say<em>, the Fourth Amendment protects you from unreasonable searches and seizures by the government. That&#x2019;s why the NSA does </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUSCULAR"><em>all sorts of stuff abroad</em></a><em> that it could never do here. </em></p><p>Ok, phew. So the FBI has to go through our court system to request my data from platforms like Google &#x2013; that&#x2019;s a relief.</p><p>But wait. Just a few months ago I read about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/09/facebook-helps-cops-prosecute-17-year-old-for-abortion/">police in Nebraska prosecuted a 17-year-old girl</a> for getting an abortion, all by using data acquired from Facebook through search warrants. And how did they get the search warrant for the girl&#x2019;s entire Facebook message history? They claimed that they had evidence that she had burned and buried the baby (because they found the fetus discarded in a bag). Once the police acquired the messages, they found evidence that she had aborted the baby, not burned it, which changed the case entirely. (Part of the problem with this case is Facebook&apos;s willingness to hand over the girl&apos;s records so readily. In fact, Facebook has stated publicly to the New York Times that it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/14/technology/personal-data-apple-google-facebook.html">complied with 89%</a> of &#xA0;search warrants it received in the first half of 2020. In comparison, Apple only complied with 43%.)</p><p>And it&#x2019;s not just the government using this online data for nefarious purposes: Google sometimes uses its own employees&#x2019; search histories to sue employees when they quit. When Google&#x2019;s two top self-driving car engineers left Google to join Uber, Google&#x2019;s parent company Alphabet sued those engineers for stealing proprietary information, alleging that they had, in the months prior to departing for Uber, Googled things like <a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/10/3/16411184/uber-alphabet-waymo-self-driving-lawsuit-anthony-levandowski-timeline">&quot;how to permanently delete google drive files from my computer&quot;</a> while still employed by Google. </p><p>(How low can Google go? C&#x2019;mon. You&#x2019;re going to not only store users&#x2019; search history data, but also your own employees&#x2019; search history data, and then use that data to sue former employees? Isn&#x2019;t this blatantly self interested data retention policy going to erode public trust in your claimed dedication to privacy at some point?)</p><p>(And for those of you who were reassured by Google&#x2019;s <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/keeping-private-information-private/">new security policy</a> that allows users to automatically delete all of their Google data every 3 months, unfortunately that policy only applies to things like Google search history, not Gmail emails themselves, which are still stored indefinitely, and which Google clearly hands over to the government fairly freely.)</p><p>Whew, okay enough of that rant against Google. I&#x2019;m clearly still bitter that they rejected my job application 7 years ago. </p><p>My point is, for those of you &#x2013; like me &#x2013; who long thought that your personal data is sitting pretty in a data center, not being used by anyone, or only being used for ad targeting purposes, I just want you to know that it <em>is</em> being used by law enforcement on a regular basis.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Coming soon]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>This is Lydia on Security, a brand new site by Lydia Stepanek that&apos;s just getting started.
